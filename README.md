# SecureAuth Monitor 🔐

SecureAuth Monitor is a Python-based authentication monitoring tool
that detects brute-force login attempts and logs suspicious activity.
It simulates how real-world systems track and respond to repeated
failed login attempts.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Logs every login attempt with timestamp, IP address, and status
- Detects repeated failed login attempts from the same IP
- Raises alerts for suspicious (brute-force-like) behavior
- Uses persistent logging similar to real authentication systems

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- Each login attempt is recorded in a log file
- Failed attempts are counted per IP address
- If failures exceed a threshold (default: 3), an alert is triggered
- A successful login resets the failure counter for that IP
